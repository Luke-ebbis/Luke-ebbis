# Hey there 👋

Hello I am Sibbe Bakker; a student in bioinformatics eager to learn 
more about the profession and collaborate. My primary language is 
python 🐍 , shell and 🇷. I am interested in learning more about rust
🦀 and julia. Additionally, older programming languages like perl
🐫 and lisp 👽 also facinate me.

For more info, please see 
[my website 🌐:](https://luke-ebbis.github.io/).

My utility scripts 💻 can be found [here](https://github.com/Luke-ebbis/script).
