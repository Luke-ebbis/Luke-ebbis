# Hey there 👋

Hello I am Sibbe Bakker, a recently graduated bioinformatician looking to learn
more about the profession. My study and work sofar has focused on building computational
pipeline and researching how researchers can better handle their research data.

My primary languages are python 🐍 , shell and 🇷. I am interested in learning more about rust
🦀 and julia. Additionally, more fundamental languages such as lisp 👽 also facinate me.

For more info, please see

My utility scripts 💻 can be found [here](https://github.com/Luke-ebbis/script).
